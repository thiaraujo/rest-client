# Rest Client

This project was developed using .NET Core technology and the idea is to allow you to use this service to consume your data at an endpoint.

## How it works

To use this project, you just need to copy the RestClient directory or just the *RequestService* file to your project and use the calls in your project.

The functions in the **RequestService** file use some conversions that the [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library provides.

This library can be used in either a C# backend, xamarin or windows forms application.
